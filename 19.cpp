/*
Create a class account that stores customer name, account
number and type of account. From this, derive the classes
cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their
requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to
achieve the following tasks: accept deposit from a customer and
update the balance, display the balance, compute and deposit
interest, permit withdrawal and update the balance, check for the
minimum balance, impose penalty, and update the balance. Do
not use any constructors. Use member functions to initialize class
members
